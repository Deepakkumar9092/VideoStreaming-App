A video streaming app allows users to watch video content in real-time without downloading it. Key features often include:

Content Delivery: Videos are delivered using streaming protocols like HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) or Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), ensuring smooth playback by adjusting video quality based on network conditions.

User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and personalize their experience, often using authentication protocols like OAuth or JWT.

Media Library: A collection of videos, organized by categories, genres, or recommendations, with search and filter options.

Adaptive Bitrate Streaming: Automatically adjusts video resolution based on user bandwidth to prevent buffering.

Video Playback Features: Includes play, pause, seek, subtitles, and volume controls, and sometimes offline download options.

Backend Architecture: Typically built using cloud services for storage, content delivery networks (CDN) for fast media access, and databases for user data management.
